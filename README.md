# ETL-PipeLine-DOAGuruInfoSystems

## GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS

Ingests (loads) a raw CSV of cryptocurrency transactions.
Cleans and validates the data.
Transforms it into useful summary outputs (like average prices, volumes, etc.).
Stores this in Delta Lake in three stages:
Bronze (Raw)
Silver (Cleaned)
Gold (Aggregated/Analytics)
Entire process should be automated and trackable, ideally using Databricks and shell scripts.
